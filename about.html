              <p class="info-description">
                Toastmasters International is a non-profit organization established in 1924. It has been dedicated to helping members improve their leadership and public speaking skills for nearly a century.
                Members engage in personalized learning experiences which are tailored to both their professional and personal needs while getting support and constructive feedback from the other members of the club.
                <br />
                <br />
                At Toastmasters, each member progresses through speaking and leadership tasks at their own pace, receiving valuable and tailored feedback along the way.
                This feedback encourages continuous improvement, prompting members to ask themselves what they can do differently or better.
                This learning approach is fundamental to all Toastmasters clubs worldwide, including ours!
